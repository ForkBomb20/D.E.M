# D.E.M
D.E.M, short for Deus Ex Machina, is a quick reference application for translating and identifying latin words.

## Installation
To install DEM there are three options, there is a windows executabel that will operate in command prompt, ther is a mac executable that will operate in terminal and ther is a mac hotbar app. All of them need only to be downloaded and then executed.

## Usage
To use the app simply enter your __SINGULAR__ latin word into the program where prompted and then D.E.M will generate a response providing all the important details for the type of form of the word you provided.
- For the mac hotbar app, you will need to choose the "Latin to English" and once you submit your word, if you wish to submit another, you will need to click on the hotbar item again.

## Limitations
- D.E.M is built off of Whitaker's Words and does not support long marks and so you may recieve multiple analyses for a given word if it could be a different form with or without long marks.
- If two different words (with different meanings) share only differences in long marks, D.E.M may provide an incorrect definition, this is an ongoing issue I am trying to fix.
